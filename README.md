DLORA(Deep Learning Object Recognition Assistant) is an add-on for deep learning inference by using IoT low-energy technologies. After the object-recognition detection phase, labeled objects are then identified based on geolocation of the object and UUID attached to the object which in turn references additional information based on that specific object.
